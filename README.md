# Roblox animation ID player
ID animation player, which plays animation ID's which are uploaded to roblox.

# The why
I just felt like making one. It was really hard to figure out how to actually do it. But when I did, it was really easy to do.

# Note
the coding style is snakecase, and if you might send commits, then code it in snakecase. Much obliged.
